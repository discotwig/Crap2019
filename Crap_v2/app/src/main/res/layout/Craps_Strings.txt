       With Craps, the only Player who must place a bet prior to the first roll of the game is the Shooter (or person who wants to roll the dice). To become eligible to become a Shooter, place a bet.
      The object of this Come Out roll is to establish a Point, which needs to be something other than a 2, 3, 7, 11 or 12.
    On the Come Out roll, if a 7 or 11 is rolled prior to establishing a Point, any Player who bet on the Pass Line wins.
        If, however, a 2, 3 or 12 is rolled, the Pass Line bet loses. The opposite is true with the Don't Pass bet, in which case, the 7 and 11 loses, and the 2, 3 and 12 wins, if rolled prior to a Point being established.</string>
